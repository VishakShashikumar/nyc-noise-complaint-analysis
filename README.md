# 🗽 NYC Noise Complaint Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes NYC 311 noise complaint data to identify spatial, temporal, and categorical patterns in urban noise disturbances. The goal is to uncover actionable insights that can inform city planning, public policy, and quality-of-life improvements.

## Objectives
- Analyze trends in noise complaints across boroughs and neighborhoods
- Identify peak complaint hours and seasonal patterns
- Examine complaint types and sources
- Visualize geographic hotspots of noise activity

## Dataset
- Source: NYC Open Data (311 Service Requests)
- Scope: Noise-related complaints
- Format: CSV
